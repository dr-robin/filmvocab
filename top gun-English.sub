{6023}{6128}Morning, Scott.|Morning, Wells.
{6197}{6339}Ghost Rider, we have an unknown|aircraft. Vector 090 for bogey.
{6611}{6709}- Who's up there?|- Cougar, Merlin, Maverick and Goose.
{6715}{6785}Great. Maverick and Goose.
{7008}{7142}- Talk to me, Goose.|- Roger, I got them. 900 knots closure.
{7148}{7232}- Cougar, you hear that?|- Roger.
{7238}{7314}- Merlin, you got them?|- I've got radar contact.
{7320}{7449}- I'll get a visual ID. You hook them.|- I'll clean them and fry them.
{7605}{7788}Ghost Rider, 203. I have them inbound,|bogeyheading 270 at 10 miles.
{7794}{7903}- 900 knots closure.|- Take angels 10, left, 3, 0.
{7909}{7991}- Are we expecting visitors?|- Negative, sir.
{8161}{8258}- Merlin, see if he's a single.|- Roger.
{8264}{8398}Do you see a trailer?.|Looks like he's a single.
{8404}{8564}- I'm gonna go head-to-head with him.|- Take it easy. I'll see if he's really alone.
{9038}{9155}- He's coming right at us, Mav.|- Okay, buddy. What's on your mind?
{9223}{9392}- Shit, there's two of them. MiG-28s!|- What? What's their position?
{9398}{9487}- 250 miles out, sir.|- Get them out of here!
{9550}{9646}Cougar, you've got MiG one.|I'm going after MiG two.
{9652}{9808}I lost him in the sun! Shit, what's|he doing? You got him, Merlin?
{9852}{9929}He's coming around on our tail!
{9935}{10021}Goddamn it. This bogey's all over me.
{10076}{10231}What's their range now?. If they break|150 miles, launch the alert five aircraft.
{10292}{10407}- Airspeed 300. Go get them, Mav!|- I'm going for missile lock.
{10413}{10573}Let's see if we can scare him|out of here. Lock up, baby.
{10579}{10670}I've got him locked. Bingo!
{10776}{10931}- We got him, Mav. He's bugging out.|- Mustang, MiG two is headed home.
{10937}{11035}- What's their position?|- 180 miles and bearing 010, sir.
{11127}{11235}- He's got missile lock on us!|- He's engaging me.
{11288}{11381}Goddamn it. Mustang,|this bogey's all over me.
{11387}{11489}- Do I have permission to fire?|- Do not fire until fired upon.
{11547}{11675}- There they are.|- The MiG's in perfect firing position.
{11680}{11816}- No way. He would have fired by now.|- Maverick, get this asshole off me!
{11881}{12032}Easy, Cougar. Bring him back,|hard right. Help me engage.
{12038}{12097}I'm on my way.
{12478}{12549}I can't shoot, so let's have a little fun.
{12687}{12737}Is this your idea of fun?
{12819}{12886}Greetings.
{12919}{12993}Watch the birdie.
{12999}{13063}Geez, I crack myself up.
{13210}{13294}Great shot.|I should be a photographer.
{13300}{13366}Cougar, your tail is clear.|MiG one has bugged out.
{13645}{13759}Cougar, we've had enough fun|for one day, don't you think?.
{13765}{13855}I'm getting low on fuel,|so we're heading home.
{13917}{13991}We'll see you on deck.
{14172}{14248}We're running low on gas.
{14293}{14377}Cougar?.
{14383}{14473}We're on vapour.|Let's do it.
{14522}{14589}Cougar, come on!
{14788}{14943}- Let's take ltback to the ship, man.|- Get him on deck as soon as possible.
{15002}{15125}Cougar, we've got to land this thing.|We are way low on gas.
{15131}{15171}Are you all right?
{15333}{15448}- Maverick, call the ball.|- Roger. Maverick has the ball.
{15526}{15625}- Cougar's in trouble.|- Come on, we're getting low on gas.
{15631}{15722}- Let's land this sucker.|- Cougar!
{15904}{15980}- Goddamn it!|- We've got no fuel for this.
{15986}{16050}We're going after Cougar.
{16056}{16226}- Tell him to land. That's an order!|- You're instructed to land immediately.
{16339}{16410}Have you boys seen an aircraft carrier?.
{16416}{16566}That MiG really screwed him up.|I don't think he can make it back.
{16638}{16796}You're okay, Cougar. Just stay on|my wing. I'll take you all the way in.
{17148}{17256}Easy, Cougar.|Just a walk in the park, buddy.
{17262}{17400}You're a little low. You're a little low.|Come on, buddy, pull up.
{17406}{17468}Pull up, Cougar.
{17511}{17590}That's it. Almost there.
{17596}{17692}A little below glide path. Call the ball.
{17726}{17801}Rogerball.
{18010}{18135}You're too low. Increase power!
{18444}{18476}Come in.
{18586}{18703}- What's on your mind?|- My wife and kid, sir.
{18709}{18824}I almost orphaned him today.|I've never even seen him.
{18830}{18932}- I was so scared.|- We've seen this before.
{18938}{18999}No, sir.
{19005}{19147}I'm holding on too tight.|I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir.
{19391}{19452}Cougar?.
{19488}{19572}Thanks, Maverick.
{19578}{19688}- Maverick, Goose, come in here.|- What the hell's going on?
{19694}{19780}- I don't know.|- Shit.
{19871}{19969}Maverick,|you just did an incredibly brave thing.
{20016}{20145}What you should have done was land|your plane. It belongs to the taxpayers!
{20151}{20223}Your ego's writing cheques|your body can't cash.
{20229}{20342}You've lost your qualifications|as section leader three times.
{20348}{20453}Put in hack twice by me|with a history of high-speed passes -
{20459}{20552}- over five air control towers|and one admiral's daughter!
{20558}{20716}- Penny Benjamin?|- You, asshole, you're lucky to be here.
{20722}{20824}Let's not bullshit. Your family name|ain't the best in the Navy.
{20830}{20939}You need to be doing it|better and cleaner than the other guy.
{20945}{21058}- Just want to serve my country, sir.|- Don't screw around with me.
{21064}{21172}You're a hell of a pilot. Maybe too good.|I'd like to bust your butt -
{21178}{21321}- but I have another problem here.|I have to send somebody to Miramar.
{21327}{21470}I've got to do something. I can't believe|it. I have to give you your dream shot.
{21476}{21608}I have to send you up against the best.|You characters are going to Top Gun.
{21653}{21731}For five weeks,|you're going to fly against the best.
{21737}{21862}You were number two. Cougar was|number one. He turned in his wings.
{21868}{21990}You guys are number one.|But you remember one thing:
{21996}{22140}You screw up, you'll be flying|a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit.
{22146}{22215}Yes, sir!
{22255}{22306}That is all.
{22312}{22413}Tell me about the MiG some other time.|Gentlemen?
{22419}{22527}- Good luck, gentlemen.|- Thank you, sir.
{23510}{23650}During Korea, we shot down 12|of theirjets for every one of ours.
{23656}{23827}During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-1 .|Our pilots were dependant on missiles.
{23833}{23961}Top Gun was created to teach ACM.|Air Combat Manoeuvring. Dogfighting.
{23967}{24070}- This gives me a hard-on.|- By the end of Vietnam, it was 12-1 .
{24076}{24149}- Don't tease me.|- Blinds, please.
{24155}{24295}Our commanding officer was the very|first man to win the Top Gun trophy.
{24301}{24425}You won't find a finer fighter pilot|anywhere. Commander Mike Metcalf.
{24431}{24529}- Call sign, Viper.|- Gentlemen ...
{24535}{24637}You're the top one percent|of all naval aviators.
{24687}{24808}The elite. The best of the best.|We'll make you better.
{24851}{24984}You fly at least two combat missions|a day, attend classes and evaluations.
{24990}{25160}On each combat sequence you're|gonna meet a different challenge.
{25166}{25333}We'll teach you to fly the F-14|faster than you've ever flown before.
{25339}{25489}Now, we don't make policy here.|Elected officials, civilians, do that.
{25495}{25679}We are their instruments and must|always act as though we are at war.
{25685}{25808}- What are you doing?|- Just wondering who's the best.
{25814}{25936}In case some of you wonder|who the best is, they're on this plaque.
{25942}{26061}The best driver and his RIO|from each class has his name on it.
{26067}{26204}They have the option to come back here|and be Top Gun instructors.
{26210}{26338}- You think you will be on the plaque?|- Yes, sir.
{26344}{26460}That's pretty arrogant,|considering the company you're in.
{26510}{26610}- Yes, sir.|- I like that in a pilot.
{26652}{26780}Remember, when it's over out there,|we're all on the same team.
{26813}{26966}This school is about combat.|There are no points for second place.
{26972}{27059}- Dismissed.|- Nice going.
{27102}{27238}The plaque for the alternates|is down in the ladies' room.
{27268}{27343}Jesus ... You kill me.
{27349}{27446}You really do ...|There's two O's in Goose, boys.
{27816}{27945}- This I call a target-rich environment.|- You live your life between your legs.
{27951}{28023}Even you could get laid in here.
{28029}{28113}I'd be happy to find a girl|who'd talk dirty to me.
{28214}{28321}You wanted to know who the best is?|That's him. Iceman.
{28365}{28424}He flies ice-cold. No mistakes.
{28430}{28570}Wears you down. You get bored,|do something stupid, and he's got you.
{28576}{28753}- I thought you wanted to be a pilot.|- Whose butt did you kiss to get here?
{28759}{28845}- The list is long but distinguished.|- So is myjohnson.
{28851}{28958}- So you're flying with lceman?|- Hey, Mother Goose, how's it going?
{28964}{29062}Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.|Tom Kazansky.
{29068}{29212}Congratulations on Top Gun. Sorry to|hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
{29218}{29333}- Still is a good man.|- Yeah, that's what I meant.
{29339}{29482}You need any help?|You figured it out yet?
{29488}{29606}- What's that?|- Who's the best pilot.
{29612}{29720}- I can figure that one out on my own.|- I heard that about you.
{29726}{29822}You like to work alone.
{29828}{29936}You're lucky. First the MiG|and then you slide into Cougar's spot.
{29942}{30003}We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.
{30009}{30131}Some pilots wait a whole career to see|a MiG up close. Lucky and famous?
{30137}{30295}- You mean notorious. See you later.|- You can count on it.
{30301}{30431}- They were abused children.|- We're gonna have a good time.
{30530}{30664}Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?|All right, the bet is 20 dollars.
{30670}{30802}You have to have carnal knowledge,|of a lady this time, on the premises.
{30808}{30908}- On the premises.|- Come on, a bet's a bet.
{30914}{31059}I don't know, it just doesn't seem fair ...|for you, I mean. But ...
{31065}{31146}She's lost that loving feeling.
{31152}{31230}No, she hasn't. She has not lost ...
{31236}{31336}- She's lost it, man. Come on.|- I hate it when she does that.
{31489}{31596}- Excuse me, miss.|- Don't worry. I'll take care of this.
{32778}{32862}- Sit down.|- Thank you.
{33045}{33204}I love that song. That's a new approach.|How long have you been doing this act?
{33210}{33307}- I don't know. Since ...|- Puberty?.
{33313}{33395}- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.|- I'm Maverick.
{33401}{33535}- Did your mother not like you?|- No, it's my call sign.
{33541}{33657}- You're a pilot?|- That's right. A naval aviator.
{33663}{33787}- Actually, we've only done this twice.|- How did you do?
{33793}{33906}- Crashed and burned on the first one.|- And the second?
{33912}{34026}I'll tell you tomorrow.|But it's looking good so far.
{34066}{34248}Well, Maverick. My friend just arrived,|so it's been great talking to you. Perry.
{34254}{34349}I'll be with you in just a second.
{34376}{34531}- Can I ask you a personal question?|- That depends.
{34537}{34681}- Are you a good pilot?|- I can hold my own.
{34687}{34850}Great. Then I won't have to worry about|you making your living as a singer.
{34991}{35149}I'm gonna need a beer to put these|flames out. Great, Mav. Real slick.
{35724}{35826}- A long cruise, was it, sailor?.|- Too long.
{35832}{35923}You want to just drop down on the tile|and go for it?
{35929}{36020}I actually had this counter in mind.
{36026}{36163}- That would be very comfortable, yeah.|- It could be.
{36202}{36360}I came in here to save you from making|a big mistake with that older guy.
{36366}{36521}Really?. So I could go on to a bigger one|with a young guy like yourself?
{36527}{36605}Maybe.
{36643}{36745}- I have to get up early in the morning.|- What are you doing?
{36785}{36888}Your friend was magnificent.
{37037}{37127}You'll also be trained and evaluated|by civilian specialists.
{37133}{37248}They are our best source of information|on enemy aircraft.
{37254}{37389}One of the most qualified is call sign|Charlie, with a Ph.D. in astrophysics.
{37395}{37562}Listen to her, because the Pentagon|listens to her about your proficiency.
{37568}{37651}All yours, Charlie.
{37657}{37808}Hello. We will be dealing with F-5s|and A-4s as our MiG simulators.
{37814}{37957}As you know, the F-5 doesn't have|the thrust-to-weight ratio of the MiG-28.
{37963}{38074}And it doesn't bleed energy|below 300 knots like the MiG-28.
{38080}{38215}However, the MiG-28 does have|a problem with its inverted flight tanks.
{38221}{38297}It won't do a negative G push-over.
{38303}{38436}The latest intelligence tells us|the most it will do is ...
{38442}{38527}Excuse me, Lieutenant.|Is there something wrong?
{38533}{38662}- The data on the MiG is inaccurate.|- How's that?
{38668}{38787}Well, I just happened to see a MiG-28 ...|Sorry, Goose.
{38793}{38931}We happened to see a MiG-28|do a four G negative dive.
{38937}{39001}Where did you see this?
{39006}{39155}That's classified. I could tell you,|but then I'd have to kill you.
{39161}{39232}I have Top Secret clearance.
{39238}{39345}The Pentagon sees to it|that I know more than you.
{39351}{39543}- Well, it doesn't seem to be the case.|- So, where exactly were you?
{39548}{39710}We started up on his six when he pulled|through the clouds. I went above him.
{39716}{39818}If you were directly above him,|how could you see him?
{39824}{39913}- Because I was inverted.|- Bullshit.
{39919}{40001}No, he was, man.|It was a really great move.
{40007}{40132}You were in a four G inverted dive|with a MiG-28?
{40138}{40208}- Yes, ma'am.|- At what range?
{40214}{40353}- About two metres?|- 11/2. I have a great Polaroid of it.
{40359}{40443}- It was a nice picture.|- Lieutenant?
{40499}{40620}- What were you doing there?|- Communicating.
{40626}{40712}Keeping up foreign relations.
{40718}{40824}- I was, you know, giving him the bird.|- You know, the finger.
{40830}{40954}- I know the finger.|- I hate it when it does that. I'm sorry.
{40960}{41050}- Excuse me.|- So you're the one?
{41056}{41170}- Yes, ma'am.|- All right, we have a hop to take.
{41176}{41306}The hard-deck on this is 10,000 feet.|There'll be no engagement below that.
{41312}{41353}Move it!
{41458}{41538}Lieutenant!
{41544}{41660}Don't be late again.|You look great, honey.
{41666}{41770}Why didn't you tell me|you were the famous MiG lnsulter?.
{41776}{41899}- Would it have made any difference?|- Not in the ladies' room.
{41905}{42071}I see 20 new hotshots every eight|weeks. I'm sure you can figure that out.
{42077}{42227}I'd just really like|to hear about the MiG sometime.
{42233}{42356}You've got security clearance.|You can read about it.
{42471}{42588}Maverick?.|I'm curious.
{42594}{42761}Who was covering Cougar while you|were showboating with his MiG?
{42767}{42817}Cougar was doing just fine.
{42890}{42995}This is your fiirsthop. Thejets you're|flying against are smaller and faster, -
{43001}{43120}-justlike the enemy MiGs.|As ofnow we are keeping score.
{43126}{43231}- I lost him, Goose.|- Show me what you've got, kid.
{43268}{43344}- I lost him.|- I'm looking.
{43384}{43484}- He's on our tail, coming hard.|- I got him. Here we go.
{43803}{43913}- Talk to me, Goose.|- He's still back there. Closing in on us.
{43919}{44026}You can run, kid, but you can't hide.
{44075}{44192}All right, Jester,|I'll give you a run for your money here.
{44294}{44352}Watch the mountains!
{44584}{44710}He's still back there. Come on, Mav,|do some of that pilot shit.
{44961}{45066}- Come on, bring it right.|- I've had about enough of this shit.
{45120}{45193}- I'll hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.|- You're mine.
{45379}{45426}Jesus Christ!
{45516}{45604}- Let's see what you've got now, Jester.|- Let's turn and burn.
{46046}{46151}- He's going vertical. So am l.|- We're going ballistic. Go get him!
{46378}{46455}He's going for the hard-deck.|Let's nail him.
{46461}{46563}No way, Jester. You're mine.
{46908}{46953}I've got you now!
{47022}{47131}- Jester's dead.|- Jester's dead.
{47186}{47274}Get your butts above the hard-deck|and return to base.
{47343}{47419}Yes, sir!
{47533}{47684}- This is Ghost Rider requesting a fly-by.|- Negative. The pattern is full.
{47690}{47819}- No, Mav. This is not a good idea.|- Sorry, but it's time to buzz the tower.
{48095}{48162}Goddamn son of a bitch!
{48255}{48307}Great balls of fire.
{48400}{48470}- Jester's dead.|- You won? Bullshit.
{48476}{48611}- Didn't everybody?.|- We got our butts kicked.
{48617}{48735}I said to Hollywood, "Where did he go?"|He said, "Where did who go?"
{48741}{48863}- And he's laughing at us on the radio.|- That was me, dickhead. We won.
{48869}{48977}- All right!|- They won too, man.
{48983}{49071}- That's not what I heard.|- We got Jester.
{49077}{49176}- Below the hard-deck doesn't count.|- We nailed that son of a bitch.
{49182}{49304}- You guys really are cowboys.|- What's your problem, Kazansky?.
{49310}{49411}You're everyone's problem.|Every time you fly, you're unsafe.
{49417}{49556}- I don't like you. You're dangerous.|- That's right, lceman.
{49562}{49650}I am dangerous.
{49686}{49798}Maverick?. You and Goose|get your butts up to Viper's office, now!
{49896}{49996}Remember, no points for second place.
{50002}{50108}- You're a lot brighter than you look.|- You shut up.
{50114}{50302}Two of your snot-nosed jockeys flew by|by at over 400 knots. I want their butts!
{50347}{50462}Damn it, that's twice.|I want some butts!
{50483}{50612}- That just about covers the fly-bys.|- Follow me.
{50717}{50843}Gentlemen. You had a hell of a first day.
{50925}{51062}The hard-deck for this hop was|10,000 feet. You knew it. You broke it.
{51068}{51243}You followed Commander Heatherly|below after he lost sight of you. Why?.
{51249}{51405}Sir, I had him in my sights.|He saw me move in for the kill.
{51411}{51573}He proceeded below the hard-deck.|We were below forjust a few seconds.
{51579}{51666}I had the shot.|There was no danger, so I took it.
{51701}{51815}You took it,|and broke a major rule of engagement.
{51821}{51963}Then you broke another one|with that circus stunt fly-by.
{51969}{52087}Top Gun rules of engagement exist|for your safety and for that of your team.
{52093}{52250}They're not flexible, nor am l. Obey them|or you're history. Is that clear?.
{52303}{52379}Yes, sir!
{52549}{52611}Dismissed.
{52710}{52840}I really enjoyed that, Mav,|thanks a lot. Holy shit.
{52921}{53095}Maybe I could be a truck driver. You got|the number of that truck-driving school?
{53101}{53219}Fitness report says it all.|He's a wild card.
{53225}{53316}Completely unpredictable.
{53322}{53421}- He got you, didn't he?|- Yeah.
{53427}{53543}Maverick. I flew with his old man.
{53640}{53798}Tell me, if you had to go into battle,|would you want him with you?
{53804}{53894}I just don't know.
{54137}{54212}- Still awake?|- Yeah.
{54286}{54358}- What's up?|- I can't sleep.
{54416}{54568}When I realised we were off to Top Gun,|all I could think about was that trophy.
{54574}{54699}I've got to be straight with you, Mav.|Right now, I just hope we graduate.
{54763}{54881}I got a family to think about.|I can't afford to blow this.
{54935}{55041}I guess that fly-by|wasn't such a big hit, huh?
{55119}{55247}I know it's tough. The Academy rejected|you because you're Duke Mitchell's kid.
{55253}{55448}You have to live with that reputation.|But it's like you're flying against a ghost.
{55454}{55555}It makes me nervous.
{55638}{55777}You're the only family I've got.|I'm not gonna let you down. I promise.
{55997}{56093}Get out of here.
{56441}{56551}A rolling reversal|would work well in that situation.
{56557}{56641}If I reversed on a hard cross,|I could go to guns on him.
{56647}{56768}But at that speed, it's too fast.|It's a little bit too aggressive.
{56774}{56880}Too aggressive?
{56886}{57008}I guess when I see something,|I go right after it.
{57014}{57155}- You didn't tell me who you were.|- I didn't get a chance. You deserved it.
{57195}{57388}I know ... but you were tempted|to ask me out for dinner.
{57394}{57505}No. I don't date students.
{57741}{57887}I can see it's dangerous for you.|But if the government trusts me ...
{57893}{57985}... maybe you could.
{58100}{58206}It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.
{58504}{58606}Crash and burn, huh, Mav?.
{58652}{58712}Slider ...
{58754}{58828}You stink.
{59039}{59086}Let's go!
{61010}{61112}Come on, Mav. Just one more game.|That evens it up.
{61118}{61223}- I got some things to take care of.|- Just one more game.
{61229}{61335}Please? For me?|Come on ... For me?
{62162}{62241}Damn it.
{62491}{62560}Lieutenant?
{62667}{62782}- What? No singing?|- Look, I'm ...
{62789}{62877}No apologies.
{63018}{63143}If you don't mind, I'll just take a quick|shower while you're finishing up here.
{63198}{63304}I do mind. I'm hungry.
{63380}{63468}And then I thought about it.
{63474}{63581}I thought,|"You know, he's a smart guy."
{63587}{63729}"Why don't you just tell him|why you've got him here?"
{63774}{63855}It's the MiG.
{63910}{64071}The MiG. You're the only pilot|who's been up against a MiG-28.
{64105}{64237}I'm trying for this big promotion.|If I get it, I won't be here much longer.
{64243}{64338}Seems to me you've got it all figured out.
{64383}{64506}Except you did forget the wine.
{64512}{64567}Sorry.
{64573}{64702}- You always get what you want?|- No, not always. Yeah, maybe.
{64708}{64815}Then relax about the MiG.
{65129}{65219}This music ...
{65225}{65306}An old friend?
{65312}{65454}My folks loved it.|I haven't heard this in years.
{65460}{65581}My mother used to call from her room|and have me play this over and over.
{65587}{65693}I got so sick of it.
{65699}{65855}But not her. She'd sit up there alone,|just listening for hours.
{65861}{66017}Just listening.|She died shortly after him.
{66023}{66130}What happened to your father?.
{66215}{66375}I figured with your security clearance|you'd know more about it than I do.
{66381}{66509}Well, I didn't get that far.
{66514}{66592}It's a big mystery.
{66598}{66711}He disappeared in an F-4,|November 5th, 1965.
{66773}{66899}The stink of it was ... he screwed up.
{66905}{67034}No way.|My old man was a great fighter pilot.
{67103}{67241}But who the hell knows?|It's all classified.
{67247}{67355}- Somebody must know.|- Yeah, somebody knows everything.
{67361}{67483}Is that why|you're always second best up there?
{67489}{67592}You are direct, aren't you.
{67742}{67839}I'm sorry I was late.
{67845}{67988}- I'm sorry for being direct.|- No apologies.
{67994}{68124}This is going to be complicated.
{68356}{68459}- Where are you going?|- I'm gonna take a shower.
{68565}{68685}Thank you. I enjoyed being here.
{69574}{69691}It looks like you need another shower.
{69697}{69779}Right.
{69875}{69956}I'm gonna be honest with you.
{69962}{70084}Your MiG sighting|is really important to my work, but ...
{70181}{70303}I don't normally invite students|to my house. You're ...
{70501}{70586}But please understand,|I still have a job to do.
{71212}{71343}I'm glad we got that straight.
{71714}{71831}I told her how tough it is here.|My ass dragging like an old tired dog.
{71837}{71916}I told her you didn't even have a woman.
{71922}{72011}She said, "He probably|doesn't have one, but eight."
{72131}{72264}- Hi!|- Daddy.
{72397}{72540}Goose tells me you're in love|with one of your instructors.
{72546}{72668}I didn't tell her that. I can't believe|you said that. That was a secret.
{72852}{72981}The bogey has good position right here.|Freeze frame. A moment of choice.
{72987}{73090}The F-14 is defensive.|He has a chance to bug out right here.
{73096}{73251}Better to retire and save your aircraft|than push a bad position.
{73257}{73382}Charlie, jump in here any time. You stay|in that diamond another three seconds, -
{73388}{73503}- the bogey's gonna blow you away.|You take a hard right, select zone five ...
{73509}{73627}You can extend an escape.|You made a bad choice.
{73633}{73805}- Charlie?|- Aircraft one performs a split S?
{73811}{73911}That's the last thing you should do.|The MiG's right on your tail.
{73917}{74075}Freeze there. The MiG has you in|his gunsight. What were you thinking?
{74081}{74189}You don't have time to think up there.|If you think, you're dead.
{74195}{74333}That's a big gamble|with a $30 million plane.
{74460}{74585}Unfortunately, it worked.|The MiG never got a clean shot.
{74591}{74749}Maverick makes an aggressive vertical|move and defeats him with a missile.
{74755}{74884}The encounter was a victory, but we|show it as an example of what not to do.
{74932}{74987}Next.
{74993}{75076}Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.
{75137}{75263}Now then, this is a perfect example|of a textbook manoeuvre.
{75553}{75594}Lieutenant?
{75903}{76022}My review of your performance was|right on, in my professional opinion.
{76028}{76119}I can't hear you.
{76561}{76713}Jesus! And you call me reckless? When|I fly, my crew and my plane come first.
{76719}{76872}I'm gonna finish my sentence. My review|of your performance was right on.
{76878}{77013}I see some real genius in your flying,|but I can't say that in there.
{77019}{77111}I was afraid they'd see right through me.
{77117}{77249}I don't want anyone to know|that I've fallen for you.
{79768}{79854}- Hey, Maverick?. Hear about lce?|- What's that?
{79860}{79959}- He won another one.|- Really?.
{79965}{80091}I fell the need ...|the need for speed.
{80169}{80307}This is hop 19. Multiple aircraft, multiple|bogeys. Your training is halfover.
{80313}{80422}The competltion for the trophy|remains tight. Firstplace, lceman.
{80428}{80506}Second, Maverick, two points behind.
{80512}{80596}There they are. Three miles, 10 o'clock.
{80602}{80725}I see them. Two A-4s.|Left 10 o'clock level. Continue left turn.
{80936}{81121}- Good morning. The temperature is 1 10.|- Viper's up here? Great. Oh, shit.
{81127}{81251}He's probably saying,|"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."
{81351}{81487}- I've got my eye on the northern bogey.|- Roger, I've got the southern guy.
{81493}{81588}Hollywood, you lead. I'll cover you.
{81846}{81901}Break now, Jester.
{81998}{82073}We're losing Viper.|Let's just stay on Jester.
{82181}{82355}- Goose, find Viper. He's out there.|- Stay with Hollywood.
{82361}{82474}- There's Viper. Three o'clock low.|- We're Hollywood's cover.
{82480}{82577}- Don't you leave me.|- Hollywood, you're looking good.
{82583}{82633}I'm going after Viper.
{82696}{82767}- Goddamn you!|- Don't leave him.
{82773}{82867}Hollywood's okay. I want Viper.
{82927}{82992}Viper's coming down.
{83143}{83225}Holy shit. We're head-to-head.
{83564}{83645}Rock and roll! Here's our big chance.
{83710}{83784}Come on, goddamn it.
{83837}{83904}Come on, keep coming.
{83979}{84074}Okay, sidewinder missile selected.|Come on, baby.
{84080}{84140}Come around. That's it.
{84284}{84467}- Jesus, he's good. Where's he going?|- Come on, come on. Keep coming.
{84537}{84621}Come on, baby.
{84699}{84766}Damn, this kid's good.
{84772}{84858}He's too close for missiles.|I'm switching to guns.
{84912}{84992}Come on, come on.
{85015}{85082}Stick with it ...
{85153}{85250}- Hold it. Check our tail.|- Shit, there's Jester!
{85256}{85373}Bingo, Maverick's dead.|You're out of there, kid.
{85379}{85548}The Defence Department regrets to|inform you your sons died of stupidity.
{85554}{85649}Knock it off, gentlemen.|Let's go home. Viper has the lead.
{85811}{85910}- 30 seconds, Wolfman. I'm coming in.|- Shut up!
{85938}{86052}That was some of the best flying|I've seen yet. Until you got killed.
{86058}{86170}You never, never leave your wingman.
{86291}{86430}Maverick ... It's not your flying,|it's your attitude.
{86463}{86639}The enemy's dangerous, but right now|you're worse. Dangerous and foolish.
{86645}{86814}You may not like who's flying with you,|but whose side are you on?
{86999}{87156}At least Viper got lceman before|he got us. We've still got a shot at it.
{87162}{87308}That was stupid, I know better than that.|That will never happen again.
{87376}{87455}I know ...
{87536}{87624}I know.
{88775}{88881}Go fetch him.|Doesn't he ever embarrass you?
{88887}{89031}- Hell no. Well, there was the time ...|- Admiral's daughter.
{89037}{89163}He told me all about the time|you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.
{89169}{89229}Did he? Great.
{89235}{89366}He tells me about all of them. My angel|Goose goes home early for church.
{89372}{89475}- You go home with the hot women.|- Thank you, Carole.
{89481}{89609}I'm gonna go embarrass myself|with Goose for a while.
{90000}{90119}I'd love to be able to warn you off about|Maverick, but I just love him to death.
{90155}{90275}I've known Pete for a lot of years.|One thing's for certain.
{90281}{90403}There are hearts breaking wide open|all over the world tonight.
{90409}{90514}Unless you are a fool,|that boy is off the market.
{90520}{90648}He is 100%%% prime time in love with you.
{90654}{90789}Hey, Goose, you big stud.|Take me to bed or lose me forever.
{90795}{90882}Show me the way home, honey.
{90888}{90963}Come on, brother, sing with the family.
{91718}{91834}Maverick, you big stud ...
{91840}{91944}Take me to bed or lose me forever.
{92238}{92320}This is hop 31.|Two weeks to graduation.
{92326}{92406}The Top Gun trophy|is still up forgrabs.
{93448}{93534}The score is tied. Time for the big one.
{93540}{93686}- Are you up for this one, Maverick?.|- Just a walk in the park.
{93732}{93844}Contact. Multiple bogeys. Two miles.|Looks like they're going away from us.
{93850}{93944}- I see them. Right, two o'clock. I'm in.|- I'm in.
{94427}{94514}That son of a bitch cut me off.
{94679}{94820}Come on. Jesus Christ, lce.|Take the shot. Get the hell out of there.
{94826}{94916}I can't get the angle. I'm too close.|I'm switching to guns.
{94922}{94997}Fire or clear!
{95108}{95252}- Christ, I can take a shot right here.|- 20 seconds and I've got him.
{95395}{95493}- I'm moving in. I've got the shot.|- Come on, Mav.
{95535}{95621}- He's getting impatient. Take the shot.|- 10 more seconds.
{95673}{95785}Get the hell out of there.|Come off my right. I'm in.
{95791}{95861}- Five more seconds.|- I'm in.
{95867}{95918}I'm off. Shit.
{95981}{96045}We're in a jetwash. Shit!
{96121}{96260}This is not good. We've got a flame-out.|Engine one is out ... Engine two is out.
{96266}{96338}I'm losing control. I can't control it!
{96440}{96531}It's coupling up. This is not good!
{96537}{96667}Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.|He's in a flat spin heading out to sea!
{96713}{96798}Altitude 8,000 ... 7,000 ...
{96804}{96871}We're at 6,000!
{96913}{96982}I can't reach the ejection handle!
{97034}{97193}- You're gonna have to punch us out.|- I can't reach the ejection handle!
{97199}{97283}- Eject ...|- Watch the canopy!
{97681}{97739}Goose ... Oh, no!
{97827}{97891}Oh, God.
{99027}{99111}Sir, let go of him.|You've got to let him go, sir.
{100153}{100292}- How are you doing?|- I'm all right.
{100298}{100395}- Goose is dead.|- I know.
{100470}{100577}You flyjets long enough,|something like this happens.
{100583}{100687}He was my RIO, my responsibility.
{100737}{100880}In my squadron in Vietnam,|we lost 8 of 18 aircraft. 10 men.
{100886}{101036}The first one dies, you die too.|But there will be others.
{101042}{101126}You can count on it.
{101132}{101222}You've got to let him go.
{101251}{101340}You've got to let him go.
{101726}{101823}I think maybe it was my fault.
{101829}{101909}I don't know.
{101915}{102010}I don't know what the hell went wrong.
{102016}{102135}I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.
{102269}{102368}God, I want him back.
{102469}{102577}I'll be here if you need me, okay?.
{105248}{105342}God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.
{105754}{105885}He would have flown anyway ...|without you.
{105891}{106024}He'd have hated it,|but he would have done it.
{106484}{106638}The spin was induced by the disruption|of air flow into the starboard engine.
{106644}{106738}This disruption stalled the engine, -
{106744}{106850}- which produced enough yaw rate|to induce a spin -
{106856}{106937}- which was unrecoverable.
{106943}{107076}There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell|could see or avoid the jetwash.
{107082}{107207}The Board of lnquiry finds that he was|not at fault in the accident of 29 July.
{107213}{107370}His record will be cleared. He's restored|to flight status without further delay.
{107398}{107481}These proceedings are closed.
{107661}{107747}Get him up flying, soon.
{108360}{108498}- Come on, kid. Get in there. Engage.|- You've got a bogey at two o'clock.
{108607}{108692}Take the shot, kid.
{108698}{108781}You can engage any time, Maverick.
{108986}{109098}- Where the hell are you going?|- It doesn't look good.
{109104}{109232}What do you mean? It doesn't get|to look any better than that.
{109486}{109583}Hey, man. We could have had him ...
{109636}{109771}I'll fire when I'm goddamn|good and ready. You got that?
{110199}{110325}- He won't engage.|- It's only been a few days.
{110331}{110478}- He just might not make it back.|- Keep sending him up.
{110971}{111035}Mitchell?
{111040}{111146}I'm sorry about Goose.
{111179}{111262}Everybody liked him.
{111358}{111438}I'm sorry.
{111863}{111957}Hi, it's Wolfman.
{111963}{112009}Maverickjust quit.
{112574}{112648}Excuse me ...
{112678}{112750}- May l?|- Please.
{112964}{113094}I'll have what he's having.|Hemlock, is it?
{113100}{113210}Ice water.
{113252}{113349}You weren't gonna say goodbye?
{113355}{113470}I heard you got that job in Washington.|Congratulations.
{113476}{113635}Thanks. But I wasn't gonna leave|without saying goodbye.
{113730}{113838}- It's good to see you.|- Thanks.
{113878}{114030}Where are you going?|You don't even have a ticket, do you?
{114036}{114202}I've seen all the evidence, and it's not|your responsibility. It's not your fault.
{114230}{114320}You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.
{114326}{114432}What you do up there ... It's dangerous.
{114438}{114558}- But you've got to go on.|- You don't understand.
{114585}{114714}When I first met you,|you were larger than life.
{114760}{114830}Look at you.
{114836}{114960}You're not gonna be happy unless you're|going Mach 2 with your hair on fire.
{114966}{115032}No, that's over. It's just over.
{115038}{115188}To be the best of the best means you|make mistakes and then you go on.
{115194}{115284}You don't think I know that?
{115290}{115368}I'm here to help.
{115374}{115563}Look, thank you. If I'd wanted help,|I would have asked for it.
{115713}{115800}So, I'm too late.
{115806}{115892}You've already left.
{115898}{116065}You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?|Except to quit.
{116103}{116222}You've got that manoeuvre down|real well.
{116355}{116436}So long, Pete Mitchell.
{117027}{117174}Hi, Maverick, come on in. How are you?|Sure you're feeling okay?.
{117180}{117287}- Great.|- Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink?.
{117293}{117413}Make yourself comfortable.|Mike will be right down.
{117878}{118020}I flew with your old man.|VF-51 , the Oriskany.
{118054}{118210}You're a lot like he was.|Only better ... and worse.
{118259}{118355}He was a natural heroic son of a bitch.
{118441}{118535}So he did do it right.
{118586}{118685}Yeah, he did it right.
{118877}{118999}Is that why you fly the way you do?|Trying to prove something?
{119034}{119123}Yeah, your old man did it right.
{119129}{119228}What I'm about to tell you is classified.|It could end my career.
{119234}{119310}We were in the worst dogfight ever.
{119316}{119460}Bogeys like fireflies all over the sky.|His F-4 was hit, -
{119466}{119537}- he was wounded, but he stayed.
{119543}{119702}- Saved three planes before he bought it.|- How come I never heard that before?
{119708}{119876}The battle occurred|over the wrong line on some map.
{119882}{119969}- So you were there?|- I was there.
{119975}{120126}- What's on your mind?|- My options, sir.
{120132}{120240}Simple.|You've acquired enough points -
{120246}{120366}- to show up tomorrow and graduate|with your class. Or you could quit.
{120419}{120520}There'll be no disgrace.|That spin was hell.
{120526}{120638}- So you think I should quit?|- I didn't say that.
{120644}{120766}You feel responsible for Goose.|And you have a confidence problem.
{120812}{120888}I won't blow sunshine up your ass.
{120894}{121001}A good pilot is compelled|to evaluate what's happened -
{121007}{121191}- and apply what he's learned. Up there,|we've got to push it. That's ourjob.
{121262}{121369}It's your option, Lieutenant.|All yours.
{121639}{121728}Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir.|Thank you for your time.
{121734}{121827}No problem. Good luck.
{122979}{123085}- Gentlemen ...|- Where's Maverick?.
{123091}{123226}- I don't know where he is.|- You know what he's planning to do?
{123254}{123366}It's got to be hard on the guy though.
{124068}{124141}- Congratulations.|- Thank you.
{124176}{124265}- Congratulations.|- Thanks, Mav.
{124327}{124473}Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party|before it gets out of hand ...
{124479}{124601}Some of you have to depart|immediately. We have a crisis situation.
{124607}{124698}Ice, Slider ...|Hollywood, Wolfman.
{124754}{124874}- Maverick.|- Sir.
{124908}{125040}Maverick, you'll get your RIO|when you get to the ship. If you don't ...
{125046}{125148}... give me a call. I'll fly with you.
{125479}{125613}The SS Layton has become disabled|and has wandered into foreign territory.
{125619}{125757}A rescue operation will soon begin.|Your mission is to give it air support.
{125763}{125926}There are MiGs in the area. If you|witness a hostile act, return fire.
{125954}{126083}They carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.|They can fire it from 100 miles away.
{126089}{126238}This is the real thing.|This is what you've been trained for.
{126244}{126365}Make us proud.|Ice ... Hollywood, sector two.
{126371}{126468}Maverick, you back them up with Merlin|on ready five.
{126474}{126553}- Yes, sir.|- Rise.
{126602}{126673}Excuse me, sir. This is not personal.
{126679}{126824}- But is Maverick the best pilot to ..?|- I know what's on your mind. Get on it.
{128718}{128799}You've got a pair of bogeys,|12 o'clock, 15 miles.
{128805}{128942}Voodoo One, 090, radar contact|15 miles. They're doing 500 knots.
{128948}{129012}Roger, that's your bogey.
{129063}{129128}Dead ahead, 15 miles, 600 knots.
{129343}{129438}They're at 15,000 feetnow, 10 miles.
{129444}{129545}800 knots. Dead ahead now, eight miles.
{129551}{129656}Wood, you got them? They must|be close. I'm getting a hard-on.
{129832}{130003}- I'm taking the lead. Let's identify them.|- Roger. I'm on your leftside, a little low.
{130009}{130078}Maverick's up and ready in alert five.
{130147}{130253}Mybogey's still locked up.|He's drifting to the left.
{130259}{130415}- Stillmanoeuvring, course 090.|- Let's bring It to the right.
{130642}{130774}Ice, we've got a problem. I have four|aircraft on radar. Four bogeys.
{130780}{130847}Wood, we've got four bogeys.
{130888}{130986}- Wrong, make that five!|- There's five, sir.
{131039}{131115}- Oh, shit!|- He's got a radar lock on us.

{131587}{131657}Wood's been hit. Wood's been hit!
{131663}{131741}Voodoo One, Wood's been hit.|We've lost Hollywood!

{132683}{132793}- They're coming in left.|- Three MiGs dead ahead.

{137156}{137243}Oh, my God.
{137249}{137362}Ice is right below with a MiG on his tail.
{137368}{137432}He's firing. Break left!
{137487}{137556}He overshot!
{137562}{137692}Coming in, lce.|I got two MiGs, dead ahead.
{137737}{137802}One MiG passing between us.

{146795}{146917}Maverick?. You're on the front pages|of all the English-speaking world.

{149779}{149874}You know,|on the first one, I crashed and burned.
{149880}{149984}And the second?
{150120}{150218}I don't know.
